## Design Approach

### a. Projectile/Bullet  
We will present a light flash effect on the tip of the gun when a shot is fired, providing instant visual feedback to the player.

### b. Muzzle Flash  
The bullet will be visually modeled and will be seen sliding out of the weapon, giving a real feel to the shooting action.

### c. Impacts  
Bullets fired at objects such as iron will produce a splash effect to add a realistic impression.

### d. Flamethrower (Optional)  
We will simulate a continuous stream of fire effect projected from the weapon's nozzle.
